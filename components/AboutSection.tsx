      <span className="font-bold">{" self-motivated"}</span>, and
      <span className="font-bold">{" driven"} </span> Web Developer.
      I have honed my skills in various technologies, including JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Next.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Nest.js, Express.js. My journey began with a specialized technician diploma in electromechanics from ISTA Casablanca, and I furthered my education at YouCode Youssoufia, where I received an attestation of success in Web Development with a focus on JavaScript. Additionally, I&apos;ve gained valuable experience through internships at Sens Things and the University Mohamed 6 Polytechnique.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Currently, I contribute to the T3-Education platform at Sens Things, where I focus on adding new features, improving user experiences, and developing robust backend services using Nest.js. My notable projects include an online booking application for reservations and preventing certificate counterfeiting for the Moroccan Baccalaureate.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth, currently enhancing my English proficiency to better communicate and collaborate in the global tech community. Outside of work, I enjoy playing football, have a background in taekwondo, and find inspiration in music, especially guitar pieces.
